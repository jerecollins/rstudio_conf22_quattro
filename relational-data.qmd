## Filtering Joins

Filtering joins match observations in the same way as [mutating joins](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html), but affect the observations, not the variables. There are two types:

|                   |     |                                                            |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `semi_join(x, y)` | $x \ltimes y$ | **Keeps** all observations in `x` that have a match in `y` |
| `anti_join(x, y)` | $x \rhd y$ | **Drops** all observations in `x` that have a match in `y` |

Graphically, a semi-join looks like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: NULL

```

Only the existence of a match is important; it doesn't matter which observation is matched. This means that filtering joins never duplicate rows like mutating joins do:
