Pre-Work for Python\n\nThis will be a R/RStudio centric course based on the attendees, but we will briefly cover other editors and Python. You are not required to install Jupyter/Python/VScode, but if you'd like to test them out:\n\n- Install Python, following instructions at [Minimum Viable Python](https://solutions.rstudio.com/python/minimum-viable-python/installing-python/)\n- Install [Jupyter](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html#installation)\n- Install VSCode, [Quarto VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto), [Python VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), [Jupyter VSCode extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-toolsai/jupyter)\n:::\n\n# Overview\n\nThis workshop is designed for those who have no or little prior\nexperience with R Markdown and who want to learn Quarto. Quarto is the\nnext generation of RMarkdown for publishing, including dynamic and\nstatic documents and multi-lingual programming language support. With Quarto \nyou can create documents, books, presentations, blogs or other\nonline resources. \n\nIn this 2 day workshop you will learn about the Quarto\nformat for technical communication and computation. We'll teach you how\nto get started creating and fully customizing Quarto outputs (HTML, PDF,\nPresentations) and the use of RStudio's Visual Editor which provides a\nuser interface for editing all of Pandoc markdown. \n\nWe will also provide\nan overview of Quarto's developer tooling support in alternative tools\nsuch as Jupyter, VS Code, and any text editors depending on learner interest. \n\nWe will briefly cover how to generate robust tables/plots in Quarto. \nLastly, we will cover Quarto Projects for aggregating many files such as \ncomplex web sites or entire books.\n\n## Learning objectives\n\n- Understand the difference between `knitr`, R Markdown, and Quarto\n- Utilize RStudio, `knitr`, and Quarto to generate static documents, websites/blogs, and presentations\n- Expand learner's toolkit regarding markdown, CSS, and Quarto-native layout options\n\n> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop at rstudio::conf 2022, but should be useful for self-guided learning as well.\n\n## Is this course for me?\n\nThis two-day workshop is primarily intended as a broad overview of\nQuarto as the next generation of RMarkdown. You should take this\nworkshop if you have experience programming in R and want to learn how\nto take advantage of Quarto for literate data science programming in\nacademia, science, and industry.\n\nThis workshop will be appropriate for attendees who answer yes to these\nquestions:\n\n-   Have you programmed in R and want to better encapsulate your code,\n    documentation, and outputs in a cohesive \"data product\"?\n\n-   Do you want to learn about the next generation of RMarkdown for data\n    science?\n\n-   Do you want to have a better interactive experience when writing\n    technical or scientific documents with literate programming?\n\n## Prework\n\nIf you are a workshop attendee and have any trouble with installation locally, please reach out to me directly!\n\n- Install latest version of RStudio, [`v2022.07.0-548` or later](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\n- Install [latest version of Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) (`v1.0.32` or greater)\n- Ideally upgrade to R 4.1 or R 4.2 (I'm showing base R pipe as `|>`)\n- Install/Update `TinyTeX` for PDF with `quarto install tool tinytex`\n- Install/Update Chromium with `quarto install tool chromium`\n- Install R packages:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npkg_list <- c(\n  \"tidyverse\", \"gt\", \"gtExtras\", \"reactable\", \"ggiraph\", \"here\", \"quarto\",\n  \"rmarkdown\", \"gtsummary\", \"palmerpenguins\", \"fs\", \"skimr\"\n  )\ninstall.packages(pkg_list)\n```\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n## Workshop Materials\n\nOn Sunday July 24th - clone/pull this repo (to get latest version)!\n<https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2022/get-started-quarto>\n\n:::\n\n## Schedule\n\n### Day 1\n\n| Time          | Activity                                              |\n|:--------------|:------------------------------------------------------|\n| 09:00 - 10:30 | [Understanding magic with Quarto](../../materials/01-intro-quarto.html) |\n| 10:30 - 11:00 | *Coffee break*                                        |\n| 11:00 - 12:30 | [Authoring with Markdown and more](../../materials/02-authoring.html)  |\n| 12:30 - 13:30 | *Lunch break*                                         |\n| 13:30 - 15:00 | [Computation and Editors](../../materials/03-computation-editors.html)                                |\n| 15:00 - 15:30 | *Coffee break*                                        |\n| 15:30 - 17:00 | [Static reports and documents](../../materials/04-static-documents.html)                           |\n\n### Day 2\n\n| Time          | Activity                         |\n|:--------------|:---------------------------------|\n| 09:00 - 10:30 | [Presentations](../../materials/05-presentations.html)                     |\n| 10:30 - 11:00 | *Coffee break*                   |\n| 11:00 - 12:30 | [Websites](../../materials/06-websites.html)                          |\n| 12:30 - 13:30 | *Lunch break*                    |\n| 13:30 - 15:00 | [Advanced plots, tables, and more](../../materials/07-plots-tables.html)  |\n| 15:00 - 15:30 | *Coffee break*                   |\n| 15:30 - 16:00 | [Going further with Quarto + `knitr`](../../materials/08-advanced-knitr.html)  |\n| 16:00 - 16:30 | Q/A with Quarto Dev team  |\n| 16:30 - 17:00 | [Going further with Quarto + `knitr`](../../materials/08-advanced-knitr.html)  |\n\n## Instructor\n\nTom Mock, PhD is the Customer Enablement Lead at RStudio, helping\nRStudio's customers be as successful as possible.
