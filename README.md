## Overview

This workshop is designed for those who have no or little prior experience with R Markdown and who want to learn Quarto. Quarto is the next generation of RMarkdown for publishing, including dynamic and static documents and multi-lingual programming language support. With Quarto you can create documents, books, presentations, blogs or other online resources. In this 2 day workshop you will learn about the Quarto format for technical communication and computation. We’ll teach you how to get started  creating and fully customizing Quarto outputs (HTML, PDF, Presentations) and the use of RStudio’s Visual Editor which provides a user interface for editing all of Pandoc markdown. We will also provide an overview of Quarto’s developer tooling support in alternative tools such as Jupyter, VS Code, and any text editors. We will briefly cover how to add interactivity to Quarto with Shiny, Observable JS, htmlwidgets or Jupyter Widgets. Lastly, we will cover Quarto Projects for aggregating many files such as complex web sites or entire books.

## Is this course for me?

This two-day workshop is primarily intended as a broad overview of Quarto as the next generation of RMarkdown. You should take this workshop if you have experience programming in R and want to learn how to take advantage of Quarto for literate data science programming in academia, science, and industry.

This workshop will be appropriate for attendees who answer yes to these questions:

- Have you programmed in R and want to better encapsulate your code, documentation, and outputs in a cohesive “data product”?

- Do you want to learn about the next generation of RMarkdown for data science?

- Do you want to have a better interactive experience when writing technical or scientific documents with literate programming?
